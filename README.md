## Description

### BallBounceFinal.aia 
Some garbage app with a draggable ball; quite buggy.


### CalculatorApp.aia 
Calculator from scratch, gave up on it. Works, though has a bug with longer equations. Figured I should not waste any other time on gibberish.

### CalculatorL.aia
Somewhat good calculator app that supports doubles using scientific notation


### CameraShooter.aia
Wholesome project for childhood. Overlay images are clipped hard on the edges, unrealistic feel. 3,5/10. 


### asyncmediametadataextraction.aia
A brief example of using the MediadataExtractor extension on media using an asynchronous model. Quite intriguing to say the least...

### dontshakemerelease.aia
Great fun, text may go out of canvas whenever content is too long. Slide from the right corner to the left to access all available languages.


### helloworlddd.aia 
Must be my worst hello world- EVER!

### multipleActivityChallenge.aia
This is the Keyboard Listener extension project template; nothing more to add.


### multipleActivityExample.aia
Very neat, straight to the point. 10/10.


### rolldice_release.aia 
The popular dice project challenge, yet with animation (Scroll to the right/left).
